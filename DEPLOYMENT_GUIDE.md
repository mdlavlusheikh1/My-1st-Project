# Deployment Guide - Secure Production Setup

## ðŸš€ Quick Start - Making Your Website Production-Ready

This guide will help you deploy your Multi-School Management System securely.

---

## Step 1: Activate Security Rules

### 1.1 Deploy Firestore Security Rules

Your production-ready Firestore rules are already in place. Deploy them:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

**Verify deployment:**
1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Firestore Database â†’ Rules
2. Confirm the rules show role-based access control
3. Test that users can only access their school's data

### 1.2 Deploy Storage Rules

```bash
firebase deploy --only storage
```

### 1.3 Deploy Database Rules

```bash
firebase deploy --only database
```

---

## Step 2: Activate Security Middleware

Rename the secure middleware file to activate security headers:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
cd "d:\LAvlu Personal\Iqra\Website\webapp\src"
Remove-Item middleware.ts
Rename-Item middleware.secure.ts middleware.ts
```

**Or manually:**
1. Delete `src/middleware.ts`
2. Rename `src/middleware.secure.ts` to `src/middleware.ts`

---

## Step 3: Set Up Firebase Admin SDK

### 3.1 Create Service Account

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Click Settings (gear icon) â†’ Project settings
4. Go to "Service accounts" tab
5. Click "Generate new private key"
6. Save the JSON file securely (DO NOT commit to Git)

### 3.2 Add Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Existing Firebase config (keep these)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Add these for Firebase Admin SDK
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_service_account_email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYour private key here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

**Important:** 
- The private key must be in quotes
- Keep the `\n` characters for line breaks
- Never commit this file to Git (it's already in .gitignore)

---

## Step 4: Create First Super Admin

**CRITICAL:** Super admins MUST be created manually in Firebase Console.

### 4.1 Create User in Firebase Auth

1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Authentication
2. Click "Add user"
3. Enter email and password
4. Copy the User UID

### 4.2 Create User Document in Firestore

1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Firestore Database
2. Click "Start collection"
3. Collection ID: `users`
4. Document ID: [paste the User UID from step 4.1]
5. Add fields:

```
email: "admin@yourschool.com" (string)
name: "Super Admin" (string)
role: "super_admin" (string)
isActive: true (boolean)
createdAt: [click "timestamp" and select current time]
updatedAt: [click "timestamp" and select current time]
```

6. Click "Save"

### 4.3 Test Super Admin Login

1. Go to your website
2. Log in with the super admin credentials
3. Verify you can access all features

---

## Step 5: Configure Production Hosting

### Option A: Deploy to Vercel

1. Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

2. Deploy:
```bash
vercel
```

3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - Go to your project settings
   - Add all variables from `.env.local`

4. Redeploy:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Option B: Deploy to Firebase Hosting

1. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Deploy:
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Option C: Deploy to Netlify

1. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Deploy using Netlify CLI or connect your Git repository

3. Add environment variables in Netlify dashboard

---

## Step 6: Enable HTTPS

**CRITICAL:** Always use HTTPS in production.

- **Vercel/Netlify:** HTTPS is automatic
- **Firebase Hosting:** HTTPS is automatic
- **Custom domain:** Configure SSL certificate

---

## Step 7: Security Testing

### 7.1 Test Role-Based Access

1. Create test users with different roles
2. Verify each role can only access appropriate data
3. Try to access other schools' data (should fail)

### 7.2 Test Security Rules

```bash
# Install Firebase emulator
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Run security rules tests
firebase emulators:start --only firestore
```

### 7.3 Check Security Headers

Visit your deployed site and check headers:

```bash
curl -I https://your-domain.com
```

Verify these headers are present:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security`

---

## Step 8: Set Up Monitoring

### 8.1 Firebase Monitoring

1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Performance
2. Enable Performance Monitoring
3. Set up alerts for security rule violations

### 8.2 Audit Log Monitoring

Create a script to check audit logs regularly:

```typescript
// Check for suspicious activities
import { collection, query, where, getDocs } from 'firebase/firestore';
import { db } from './lib/firebase';

async function checkSuspiciousActivities() {
  const logsRef = collection(db, 'systemLogs');
  const q = query(
    logsRef, 
    where('severity', 'in', ['error', 'critical']),
    where('timestamp', '>=', new Date(Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000))
  );
  
  const snapshot = await getDocs(q);
  console.log(`Found ${snapshot.size} security events in last 24 hours`);
}
```

---

## Step 9: Backup Strategy

### 9.1 Automated Firestore Backups

Set up automated backups:

```bash
# Using gcloud CLI
gcloud firestore export gs://your-backup-bucket
```

### 9.2 Schedule Regular Backups

Use Cloud Scheduler or cron jobs to run backups daily.

1. **Immediate Response:**
   ```bash
   # Disable affected user
   firebase auth:users:delete [USER_ID]
   
   # Review audit logs
   # Check systemLogs collection in Firestore
   ```

2. **Investigate:**
   - Check audit logs for timeframe
   - Identify compromised data
   - Find entry point

3. **Remediate:**
   - Fix vulnerability
   - Update security rules
   - Reset passwords
   - Notify affected users

4. **Document:**
   - Record incident details
   - Update security procedures
   - Implement additional safeguards

---

## ðŸ“Š Performance Optimization

### After Security Setup:

1. **Enable Firestore Indexes:**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
   ```

2. **Optimize Images:**
   - Use WebP format
   - Implement lazy loading
   - Use Next.js Image component

3. **Enable Caching:**
   - Configure CDN
   - Set cache headers
   - Use service workers

---

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Issue: "Permission denied" errors**
- **Solution:** Check Firestore rules are deployed
- Verify user has correct role in Firestore
- Check user's `isActive` status

**Issue: Security headers not showing**
- **Solution:** Verify middleware.ts is active (not middleware.secure.ts)
- Rebuild and redeploy the application
- Clear browser cache

**Issue: Admin SDK authentication fails**
- **Solution:** Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify private key format (must include `\n` characters)
- Ensure service account has correct permissions

**Issue: Rate limiting too aggressive**
- **Solution:** Adjust limits in `src/lib/security.ts`
- Clear rate limit cache: `clearRateLimit(key)`
